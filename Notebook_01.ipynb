    "### Teaching Approach\n",
    "#### Top-Down Method\n",
    "I will be employing a *top-down* teaching method, which contrasts the traditional *bottom-up* approach. In a *bottom-up* approach, you typically learn all the individual components first and then gradually combine them into more complex structures. This approach often leads to students losing motivation, lacking a sense of the \"big picture,\" and not knowing what they will need in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to Harvard Professor David Perkins in his book [Making Learning Whole](https://www.amazon.com/Making-Learning-Whole-Principles-Transform/dp/0470633719), effective learning can be likened to learning a sport like baseball. Children are not required to memorize all the rules and understand every technical detail before they start playing. Instead, they begin by playing with a general understanding and gradually learn more rules and details over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Focus on Functionality\n",
    "At the beginning of this course, prioritize understanding what things **do**, not necessarily what they **are**. You will encounter some \"black boxes\"—concepts or tools that we use without fully explaining them upfront. Later, we will get into the lower-level details.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Learning by Doing and Explaining\n",
    "Research indicates that people learn best by:\n",
    "1. **Doing**: Engaging in coding and building projects.\n",
    "2. **Explaining**: Articulating what they've learned, either by writing or helping others.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will guide you through building projects and encourage you to explain these concepts to your peers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Learning as a Team Sport\n",
    "Studies show that teamwork significantly enhances learning. Therefore, I encourage you to:\n",
    "- Ask questions.\n",
    "- Answer questions from fellow students.\n",
    "- Collaborate on building projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you receive a request for help, consider it an opportunity to solidify your understanding by teaching others."

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "### Keypoints\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data-Centric AI is a example shift in AI development, focusing on the critical role of data quality and quantity rather than solely on model architecture improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The three key principles of Data-Centric AI are:\n",
    "1. It centers around data as the primary driver of AI success.\n",
    "2. It needs to be programmatic to overcome the limitations of manual data labeling.\n",
    "3. It requires the inclusion of subject matter expertise in the development process.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Weak supervision is a powerful technique for addressing the challenge of limited labeled data, leveraging domain knowledge and heuristics to create large-scale labeled datasets efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are three primary types of weak supervision:\n",
    "1. Incomplete supervision: Only a subset of the training data is labeled.\n",
    "2. Inexact supervision: Labels are less precise or fine-grained than ideal.\n",
    "3. Inaccurate supervision: Labels contain errors or noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Weak supervision can achieve comparable or even superior performance to traditional supervised learning in various tasks, often requiring about twice as much weakly labeled data to match the performance of manually annotated datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Aggregating multiple, potentially noisy labeling sources is a critical aspect of weak supervision, with techniques ranging from simple majority voting to advanced methods like graph neural networks and matrix completion.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Even widely used benchmark datasets contain significant labeling errors, underscoring the need for techniques to automatically detect and correct annotation errors in both human-annotated and weakly supervised datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- The focus in AI development is shifting from model architecture to data quality and management, emphasizing the importance of data curation, augmentation, and governance in achieving high-performance AI systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Weak supervision offers a scalable and cost-effective alternative to traditional manual data labeling, particularly valuable in domains where expert knowledge is required or when dealing with large-scale datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The effectiveness of weak supervision challenges the notion that only carefully hand-labeled datasets can produce high-quality machine learning models, opening up new possibilities for AI development in data-scarce or expertise-intensive domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Integrating subject matter experts into the AI development process is crucial for creating effective labeling functions and ensuring the relevance and accuracy of the resulting models.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The asymptotic scaling behavior of weak supervision methods matches that of traditional supervised learning, suggesting that effective use of unlabeled data can yield strong predictive performance similar to fully supervised methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "- As AI systems become more prevalent in critical applications, understanding and mitigating the impact of label noise and errors is increasingly important for ensuring the reliability and trustworthiness of these systems."

    "\n",
    "#### The Challenge of Manual Data Labeling\n",
    "\n",
    "In the current landscape of AI development, a significant bottleneck exists in the form of manual data labeling. This process often requires:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Large teams of human labelers\n",
    "- Extensive time and resources\n",
    "- Specialized knowledge for domain-specific tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "While this approach has been necessary, it presents several critical limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Scalability Issues**: As datasets grow larger and more complex, manual labeling becomes increasingly impractical.\n",
    "2. **Cost Inefficiency**: Hiring and maintaining large teams of labelers is expensive and often unsustainable for many organizations.\n",
    "3. **Time Constraints**: Manual labeling is time-consuming, slowing down the development and iteration of AI models.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Impracticality for Real-World Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "For many real-world AI applications, especially those dealing with sensitive or specialized data, manual labeling faces additional challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Privacy Concerns**: In fields like healthcare or law, data often contains sensitive personal information that cannot be easily shared with labelers.\n",
    "- **Expertise Requirements**: Certain domains require highly specialized knowledge for accurate labeling:\n",
    "- Legal cases need judges or lawyers\n",
    "- Medical data requires physicians or specialists\n",
    "- Technical fields may require subject matter experts\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Example**: Imagine developing an AI for rare disease diagnosis. Each case would need to be labeled by a specialist in that particular rare condition, making the process extremely time-consuming and expensive. This data may also be sensitive and require strict privacy measures, further complicating the labeling process.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Problem of Evolving Information\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most significant issues with manual labeling is its static nature in a dynamic world:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Rapid Information Changes**: New laws, medical discoveries, or technological advancements can quickly render existing labels obsolete.\n",
    "- **Continuous Updates Needed**: Adding new classes or modifying existing ones requires re-labeling large portions of the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Analogy**: Think of manual labeling like printing a paper encyclopedia. By the time it's complete, some entries are already outdated, and adding new information requires reprinting the entire set.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Call for Programmatic Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "To address these challenges, the field is moving towards more programmatic approaches to AI development:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Automated Labeling Techniques**: Developing algorithms that can label data with minimal human intervention.\n",
    "2. **Transfer Learning**: Employing knowledge from pre-trained models to reduce the need for extensive labeled datasets.\n",
    "3. **Active Learning**: Implementing systems that intelligently select the most informative samples for labeling, reducing overall labeling requirements.\n",
    "4. **Synthetic Data Generation**: Creating artificial datasets that mimic real-world data characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "These programmatic approaches offer several advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scalability**: Can handle large and growing datasets more efficiently.\n",
    "- **Adaptability**: Easier to update and modify as new information becomes available.\n",
    "- **Cost-Effectiveness**: Reduces the need for large teams of human labelers.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Understanding Fully Supervised Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Fully supervised learning (or just traditional supervision) is a fundamental concept in machine learning where we aim to learn a function that maps input features to output labels using a labeled dataset. This approach forms the basis for many practical applications in data science and machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Components of Fully Supervised Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Function Mapping**: The key goal is to learn a function $f: \\mathcal{X} \\rightarrow \\mathcal{Y}$\n",
    "- $\\mathcal{X}$ represents the input space (features)\n",
    "- $\\mathcal{Y}$ represents the output space (labels)\n",
    "- $f$ is the function that establishes the relationship between $\\mathcal{X}$ and $\\mathcal{Y}$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Dataset Structure**: We work with a dataset $\\mathcal{D} = \\{(x_1, y_1), ..., (x_m, y_m)\\}$\n",
    "- Each pair $(x_i, y_i)$ represents an input-output example\n",
    "- $x_i \\in \\mathcal{X}$: An instance from the input space\n",
    "- $y_i \\in \\mathcal{Y}$: The corresponding label from the output space\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Output Space Variations**: The nature of $\\mathcal{Y}$ defines the type of supervised learning task:\n",
    "- Binary Classification: $\\mathcal{Y} = \\{\\text{Yes}, \\text{No}\\}$\n",
    "- Multiclass or Multilabel Classification: $\\mathcal{Y} = \\{\\text{Class}_1, \\text{Class}_2, ..., \\text{Class}_n\\}$\n",
    "- Regression: $\\mathcal{Y} = \\mathbb{R}$ (real numbers)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Learning Process\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Collection**: Gather a representative dataset with input-output pairs.\n",
    "2. **Feature Selection**: Identify relevant attributes of the input space.\n",
    "3. **Model Selection**: Choose an appropriate algorithm or model architecture.\n",
    "4. **Training**: Use the labeled data to optimize the model's parameters.\n",
    "5. **Validation**: Assess the model's performance on unseen data.\n",
    "6. **Fine-tuning**: Adjust hyperparameters or model structure as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objective Function\n",
    "\n",
    "In supervised learning, we typically aim to minimize a loss function $\\mathcal{L}$:\n",

    "## Overcoming the Unavailability of Labels: Weak Supervision\n",
    "\n",
    "Weak supervision is a powerful technique for addressing the challenge of limited labeled data in machine learning. This approach leverages domain knowledge and heuristics to create large-scale labeled datasets efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts of Weak Supervision\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Programmatic Labeling**:\n",
    "- Labels are generated through heuristics that encapsulate domain expertise.\n",
    "- These heuristics act as labeling functions, automatically assigning labels to data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Weak Labels to Strong Classifiers**:\n",
    "- Classifiers trained on weak labels can generalize beyond the specific patterns in the heuristics.\n",
    "- This generalization ability is crucial for capturing complex relationships in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Quantity vs. Quality Trade-off**:\n",
    "- Typically, twice as much weakly labeled data is needed to match the performance of manually annotated datasets.\n",
    "- However, the cost-efficiency of weak labeling often outweighs this requirement.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Scalability**:\n",
    "- A significant advantage of weak supervision is its scalability.\n",
    "- The cost difference between generating 1 or 1 million labels is minimal, making it highly efficient for large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Effectiveness of Weak Supervision\n",
    "\n",
    "Empirical evidence supports the efficacy of weak supervision:\n",
    "\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n",
    "<img src=\"images/ws1.png\" width=\"70%\" height=\"70%\">\n",

    "These images demonstrate that weak supervision can achieve comparable or even superior performance to traditional supervised learning in various tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Aggregating Noisy Labels\n",
    "\n",
    "A critical aspect of weak supervision is combining multiple, potentially noisy labeling sources:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Simple Methods**:\n",
    "- Majority voting is a straightforward approach but may not capture complex relationships between labeling functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Advanced Techniques**:\n",
    "- Graph neural networks and matrix completion methods offer more sophisticated aggregation.\n",
    "- These techniques can model elaborate dependencies and correlations among labeling functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Unsupervised Accuracy Estimation**:\n",
    "- It's possible to estimate the accuracy and correlations of heuristics without ground truth labels.\n",
    "- This capability is crucial for assessing the reliability of weak labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Practical Implementation**:\n",
    "- Typically, a small set (400-600) of manually labeled observations is used to calibrate and validate the weak labeling process.\n",
    "- This calibration set helps in refining heuristics and assessing their performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Probabilistic Labeling**:\n",
    "- The aggregation process results in a single probabilistic label for each observation.\n",
    "- This probabilistic approach captures the uncertainty innate in weak labeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reliability of Weakly Labeled Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "An important question arises: Can we trust weakly labeled datasets? This inquiry leads to a more fundamental question about the reliability of human-annotated datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Key Insight**: Even widely used benchmark datasets contain significant labeling errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of label error rates in popular datasets ([Northcutt et al, 2021](http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.14749)):\n",
    "- CIFAR-100: 5.85%\n",
    "- ImageNet: 5.83%\n",
    "- Google QuickDraw: 10.12%\n",
    "- IMDB Reviews: 2.9%\n",
    "- Amazon Reviews: 3.9%\n",
    "\n",
    "These findings underscore the need for techniques to automatically detect and correct annotation errors, regardless of whether the labels come from human annotators or weak supervision pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theoretical Foundation\n",
    "\n",
    "The effectiveness of weak supervision and error detection is grounded in the non-random nature of label noise. As demonstrated by [Angluin and Laird (1988)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1023/A%3A1022873112823):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(\\tilde{\\mathcal{y}}_\\text{ tree photo} \\mid \\mathcal{y^*}_\\text{flower photo}) > P(\\tilde{\\mathcal{y}}_\\text{ tree photo} \\mid \\mathcal{y^*}_\\text{computer photo}) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This inequality illustrates that mislabeling is more likely between similar classes (e.g., tree and flower) than dissimilar ones (e.g., tree and computer).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Application\n",
    "\n",
    "I've had a practical example of weak supervision's effectiveness comes from a project for the Brazilian National Council of Justice and the United Nations Development Programme:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scope**: Legal data classification for environmental crimes\n",
    "- **Scale**: 135,668 data points labeled across 20 classification tasks\n",
    "- **Efficiency**: Completed within days using a single legal expert to design labeling functions\n",
    "- **Performance**: Our labels where correct within the 93-100% range, which is better than most benchmark datasets from the [Northcutt et al, 2021](http://arxiv.org/abs/2103.14749) study above.\n",
    "\n",
    "This case study demonstrates the power of weak supervision in rapidly generating large-scale labeled datasets in specialized domains with minimal expert involvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Asymptotic Scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Ratner et al](http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.02840) show that, as the number of unlabeled data points $ \\mathcal{n} $ increases, the generalization error decreases at a rate proportional to $ \\mathcal{n}^{-\\frac{1}{2}} $.\n",
    "- This scaling behavior is significant because it matches the rate found in traditional supervised learning, where the generalization error also typically scales as $ \\mathcal{n}^{-\\frac{1}{2}} $ with respect to the number of labeled data points.\n",
    "- The key result is that even though you are primarily using unlabeled data (which has been labeled through the label model $ \\hat{\\mu} $), you achieve the same asymptotic error scaling as if you were using labeled data directly.\n",
    "- This finding is valuable because it suggests that effective use of unlabeled data, when combined with a robust label model, can yield a strong predictive performance similar to traditional supervised learning methods."
